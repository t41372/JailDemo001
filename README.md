# gameProjectDemo001
This is a demo project I created for my Unity learning and practice for the school-base game making project. This is also a sort of Unity-RPG skills Lab for learning purpose. This repository is created at 2020.5.4 in order to help myself to use git with unity

## How to program based on this program
I had provided the documentation for most of the api in this program in the file "AVG Game Project Document.md", and you can take a look at it.
